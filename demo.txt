Total number of challenges in easy level: 10

1) To calculate the probability of "Success rate < 0.5" of array category:

    P(Array | Success rate < 0.5) 
        = P(Success rate < 0.5 | Array) * P(Array) 
            / Normalized constant

        = 0.51 * 0.2 / Normalized constant

2) Repeat this for each category.

3) Compare which category has the lowest probability of success rate.

4) Pick a challenge from that category randomly.
